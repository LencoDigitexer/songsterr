I stand corrected. It should be noted, however, that not every song on Master of Reality is in C# standard. I believe After Forever is in D standard, and Solitude is in E.","createdAt":"2020-08-17T21:17:30.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42958612.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Sweet Leaf","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":400275,"songId":86850,"description":"- Added vocals and lyrics\n- Made corrections to the main guitar part pretty much everywhere\n- Made a few corrections to the bass part\n- Added section markers\nAlso, as a note to anybody who thinks that this should be in C#: Not all of the songs on Master of Reality were tuned to C#. The Wikipedia page states that only Children of the Grave, Lord of this World, and Intro the Void were downtuned.","createdAt":"2020-04-05T19:43:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41721947.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Sweet Leaf","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":220361,"songId":86850,"description":"Unpopular and less accurate revision, as stated in the comments.
