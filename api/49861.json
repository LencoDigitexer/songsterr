[{"revisionId":569944,"songId":49861,"description":"This is possibly actually in D standard (425 Hz) because of bars 148 & 149 . Bar 6,58, &147 isn't a power chord to my ears, the fifth is flattened. Notated in E here with whammy pedal for those parts. If you havn't got a whammy, you'll need to drop the low E to D and transcribe appropriately. Nearly all the parts were wrong in this and other tabs on the internet either 1 fret too high or low through out or in some cases totally wrong, where people have guessed because of the odd tuning.  Not that odd really.  Tune to where you tuner is on the edge of being too sharp for Eb and too flat for E. That's a quarter step. Lead parts maybe suspect. But rhythm parts should all be right now. Hopefully someone can use this as a base to improve upon further.","createdAt":"2023-05-06T11:29:52.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56846492.gp","personId":2460063,"person":"John Roberts","title":"Live In A Hole","artist":"Pantera","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":431821,"songId":49861,"description":"fixed pm for real this time","createdAt":"2021-02-07T20:31:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44649806.gp5","personId":1610404,"person":"UnchainedSoul3","title":"Live In A Hole","artist":"Pantera","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":3},{"revisionId":431820,"songId":49861,"description":"Fixed pms","createdAt":"2021-02-07T20:29:56.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44649805.gp3","personId":1610404,"person":"UnchainedSoul3","title":"Live In A Hole","artist":"Pantera","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":431806,"songId":49861,"description":"Merged solo tracks into main track.
