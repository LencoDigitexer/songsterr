[{"revisionId":630440,"songId":389683,"description":"Fixed a lot of the mistakes to whoever messed up Skwisgaars lead part. Brendon Small does a playthrough of Skwisgaars track on Youtube and I have slowed the video down and redid most of the parts. The outro harmony is incorrect as the section on this track played by Toki should be Skwisgaars and Skwisgaars should be Tokis as seen on Brendon Smalls video. Furthermore there are inaccurate notes within the ending harmony from bars 79 to bars 94.\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-10-18T15:59:59.833Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/export.740576.gp","personId":1463298,"person":"Aaron","title":"The Duel","artist":"Dethklok","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":555053,"songId":389683,"description":"Distortion guitar for Skwis and Toki","createdAt":"2023-03-15T15:19:44.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55853160.gp5","personId":2137482,"person":"tru_","title":"The Duel","artist":"Dethklok","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":553017,"songId":389683,"description":"Added band","createdAt":"2023-03-08T03:00:10.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55718335.gp5","personId":2137482,"person":"tru_","title":"The Duel","artist":"Dethklok","tracksCount":7,"reports":[{"kind":"errors","summary":""}],"commentsCount":1},{"revisionId":331906,"songId":389683,"description":"Fixed everything, tuning, notes, even added that little part where Toki screws up.","createdAt":"2017-04-19T14:30:47.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/25682173.gp5","personId":951097,"person":"Shadows","title":"The Duel","artist":"Dethklok","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":1},{"revisionId":236135,"songId":389683,"description":"The guitar of Skwisgaar most be on distortion guitar","createdAt":"2014-03-29T23:27:02.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15300654.gp5","personId":790651,"person":"Kenji","title":"The Duel","artist":"Dethklok","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
