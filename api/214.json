The poem also mentions in stanza 4 that if one does not have the ability to sing they would surely die meaning that life and death aren't too dissimilar and that the song of life is also part of death. There is also the constant mention of the spring season which can be seen as symbolizing the cycle of life and death or maybe even rebirth. This point is driven even further home with the mention of the \"ever-returning spring\" in the first and second stanzas.","createdAt":"2022-10-03T23:45:42.630Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/52609766.gp5","personId":1610404,"person":"UnchainedSoul3","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":517625,"songId":214,"description":"reupload same as before","createdAt":"2022-10-03T23:45:07.625Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/52609765.gp5","personId":1610404,"person":"UnchainedSoul3","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":517622,"songId":214,"description":"","createdAt":"2022-10-03T23:29:47.320Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/52609300.gp5","personId":1610404,"person":"UnchainedSoul3","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":496052,"songId":214,"description":"added names","createdAt":"2022-06-02T01:44:20.190Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/50526085.gp5","personId":1390559,"person":"Noopy","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":487191,"songId":214,"description":"fixed bridge section on bass. you can hear it's not empty by listening to some isolated tracks.","createdAt":"2022-03-31T20:17:27.396Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49712228.gp5","personId":2321165,"person":"Pavanetto","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":438008,"songId":214,"description":"Fixed 1 more rendering error","createdAt":"2021-04-03T21:22:27.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/45223700.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":438006,"songId":214,"description":"Fixed lyrics rendering error","createdAt":"2021-04-03T21:21:30.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/45223691.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":438005,"songId":214,"description":"Updated solo","createdAt":"2021-04-03T21:20:25.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/45223690.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":431351,"songId":214,"description":"Added slurs to vocals","createdAt":"2021-02-03T18:52:41.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44609420.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":426619,"songId":214,"description":"Fixed drums just a tiny bit.","createdAt":"2020-12-22T19:41:45.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44166550.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":426613,"songId":214,"description":"Fixed lyrics spacing for realsies","createdAt":"2020-12-22T19:17:36.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44166246.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":426612,"songId":214,"description":"Fixed lyrics spacing","createdAt":"2020-12-22T19:03:56.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44166099.gp5","personId":1524373,"person":"TheLarkShark","title":"American Idiot","artist":"Green Day","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":426611,"songId":214,"description":"Where to begin with this…\nCreated from scratch using the stems.
