Yay!\n\nI fixed tempos as best I could. This song seems to fluctuate from measure-to-measure in some parts. All tempos are within 1-2 bpm of the recording for the section.\n\nAdded in the missing notes/measures:\n- 2 eighth notes in m.26\n- 16 measures at m.243\n- 2 at m.257\n- 1 at m.304\n\nI also changed the random 3/4 measure near the end to a 4/4, fixed the parts to line up properly, and removed the long, 8-measure hold on the solo's final note.\n\nI also changed that random 2-note fret climb in measure 356 (old measure, now measure 386) for bass.","createdAt":"2016-01-23T19:07:27.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17974877.gp5","personId":775293,"person":"Maian","title":"Mercyful Fate","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
