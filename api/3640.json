[{"revisionId":246710,"songId":3640,"description":"I went through and fixed up a lot of stuff. It's not a perfect tab, but it's a lot better than the previous one.\n\nThis is what I did:\n\n* Got rid of all of the lazily placed repeats\n\n* Fixed many of the guitar and bass riffs (they're still not perfect, though.)\n\n* Almost completely fixed the drums\n\n* Added names\n\nThat's all I did. And sorry if the volumes in the tab end up unbalanced, I have absolutely no control over them. :{","createdAt":"2014-11-29T17:32:45.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15855287.gp5","personId":879206,"person":"Bryce V.","title":"Buried By The Dead","artist":"Bloodbath","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
