[{"revisionId":180039,"songId":47986,"description":"There were several things wrong with this tab. For one, it was in the wrong time signature. It is in 3/4, not 6/4. Secondly, the tempo was way too slow. I upped it 12 bpm and I still think that is a tiny bit slower than what the song is in the studio. Finally, the bass section was horribly inaccurate. I made it as accurate as I possibly could, so now I believe the tab is a much better aid to those wanting to learn this song.","createdAt":"2012-07-16T13:19:59.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/11627999.gp5","personId":445467,"person":"Zach","title":"Spiral Static","artist":"Muse","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
