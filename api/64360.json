[{"revisionId":272119,"songId":64360,"description":"I changed only the guitar tracks. I changed some timings in the riffs, added some quiet notes that were hard to hear, rewrote the solos and almost completely changed the outro. I made a lot of changes so it would be impossible to describe them in more detail. I am not sure in which key the guitar harmony is (I put it 7 half-tones lower). It probably isn't perfect, but I think it's much better than the last version.","createdAt":"2016-07-20T00:54:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/19212632.gp5","personId":1049355,"person":"dario333","title":"Kindergarten","artist":"Faith No More","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
