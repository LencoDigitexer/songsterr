The first half of Piano 1 had unnecessary 64th rests, which I removed. Piano 3 had notes that did not match with the tab, so I tuned it down 1 step.","createdAt":"2013-06-12T21:47:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/13983418.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Pumped Up Kicks","artist":"Foster The People","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
