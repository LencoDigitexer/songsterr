I merged the tabs, fixed some issues, however the rhythm guitar is currently missing as I do not have the time to change that, may come in a later revision. Found something playable as there were issues with both previous revisions of the tabs, tried to make it as comfortable to play without severely diminishing the originality to audio quality, took some inspiration from Joao Medeiros tab in some areas, however most of the tab remains the same. There may be some issues however it seems fine in GP5 atm.","createdAt":"2023-05-21T04:08:49.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/57117536.gp5","personId":2288984,"person":"Impulse","title":"Modern misery","artist":"Architects","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":386390,"songId":453387,"description":"Everything is better","createdAt":"2019-10-20T20:56:24.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40395501.gp5","personId":1275648,"person":"Ryan_Burton","title":"Modern misery","artist":"Architects","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":378047,"songId":453387,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2019-06-21T00:16:06.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39579548.gp5","personId":1275648,"person":"Ryan_Burton","title":"Modern misery","artist":"Architects","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
