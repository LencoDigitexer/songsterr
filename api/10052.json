As recommended, I reverted the bass part to the original. The guitar solo (played by Adrian Smith) was moved back to its own track. Both guitar parts were re-arranged and I corrected as much as I could. Keyboard and vocal tracks were re-added. Vocal track definitely still has problems but I added lyrics anyway. Drums were kept the same as the previous version. I am unsure of the strum patterns I added in Adrian's part (specifically m. 6, 10, etc.), but that's how I've been playing it. Overall, the tab is not quite perfect, but it's one step closer.","createdAt":"2017-12-22T05:35:39.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36115291.gp3","personId":551392,"person":"Steve","title":"Can I Play With Madness","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":232383,"songId":10052,"description":"jklj","createdAt":"2014-01-05T23:56:40.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15098398.gp3","personId":164748,"person":"GuitarMan","title":"Can I Play With Madness","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
