I removed lyric markers and replaced with Verse/Chorus/Solo. Fixed notation on intro, it was missing a full measure and had several errors. The measures on the main riff were off by half a measure throughout the song and had incorrect rhythms. There are variations I have not accounted for that I will submit at a future time, with the guitar solo and keyboard solo.","createdAt":"2020-06-02T17:13:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42271617.gp5","personId":154452,"person":"Sam Cottrell","title":"From The Beginning","artist":"Emerson, Lake & Palmer","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":273583,"songId":33983,"description":"Fuller version as requested.
