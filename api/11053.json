I downloaded it from here just now with no problems, but it may have just been an issue on Songsterr's side that has since been resolved.","createdAt":"2023-10-01T16:35:05.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43418057.505299.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Carry On Wayward Son","artist":"Kansas","tracksCount":11,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":402437,"songId":11053,"description":"- Changed slides to slurs in vocal track\n- Corrections to piano track\n- Added chord symbols\n- Corrections to acoustic and clean guitar tracks\n- Added organ solo\n- Corrections to bass track\n- Corrections to lead track\n- Added/edited some section markers\n- Corrections to rhythm guitars\n- Added swing where needed, changed triplet quarter eighths to regular eighths\n- Made tracks look cleaner","createdAt":"2020-04-26T20:16:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41904956.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Carry On Wayward Son","artist":"Kansas","tracksCount":11,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":396665,"songId":11053,"description":"- Made a few minor changes to the riff\n- Clean guitar should hopefully now use the correct instrument","createdAt":"2020-02-26T23:59:44.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41393533.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Carry On Wayward Son","artist":"Kansas","tracksCount":11,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":377572,"songId":11053,"description":"Changed instrument of keyboard parts.","createdAt":"2019-06-12T19:22:28.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39531809.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Carry On Wayward Son","artist":"Kansas","tracksCount":11,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":377566,"songId":11053,"description":"Changed the names of tracks.\nAdded Keyboard parts.\nFixed the rhythm for the riff around 143\nVocals: Added lyrics\nPiano: Corrected the verses to the best of my ability, added what the piano plays around measure 15.
