I also rearranged the bass tracks slightly so that both the rhythm and solos are in the same bass track, like what is usually done with guitars. This should stop some of the complaints. I changed the sawtooths to distortion guitars, because sawtooth sounds terrible, but that is just my opinion. Finally, I removed some of the error reports that were just saying that the new tab was bad without justifying why. I believe that Pan-Fukin'-Tera's version is pretty accurate and better than the previous versions, but if you are going to say otherwise you should justify what you think makes it incorrect or inaccurate.","createdAt":"2017-01-27T09:26:30.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24568497.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Orion","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":281533,"songId":12369,"description":"Cleaned up the tracklist a bit","createdAt":"2016-10-11T19:15:05.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/20575898.gp5","personId":1126131,"person":"Pan-fukin'-tera","title":"Orion","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
