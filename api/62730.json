Main bass riff was wrong as Nick slides up from the 2nd fret, not playing the 7th fret like in the original tab (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1RQsIxinp8). Outro notes and tempo was wrong too so I also changed that.","createdAt":"2015-09-23T17:26:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17548247.gp5","personId":1013290,"person":"Sketch","title":"Potion Approaching","artist":"Arctic Monkeys","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
