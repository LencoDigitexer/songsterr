The chorus tab is just wrong, I fixed and Philip made it not only harder to play, but inaccurate. This tab is for how it is meant to be played. Here's proof (look at Syn on the left, he is the only one playing the harmony): https://youtu.be/dgzvl_Oa0w8?t=423 . If you're going to tab, show evidence of where you found that it is played like that by Syn or Zack and tab them accordingly. I tabbed the 1rst solo start, so here's proof: https://youtu.be/pky5K3EXz5k?t=10\nWant to fix the solo? See the video, analyze it like I had to, and tab it like he plays it. Tabs are meant to show how they are played and I like to keep them how the musician played it originally so thanks. Also, if you want to re-tab the end here's reference, but am sure it's tabbed correctly: https://youtu.be/dgzvl_Oa0w8?t=430\nWhat needs to be re-tabbed, is the outro guitar for Syn and Zack, if you could re-tab that, it would be very nice.","createdAt":"2020-10-05T04:46:46.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43418641.gp5","personId":1900642,"person":"Clay","title":"The
