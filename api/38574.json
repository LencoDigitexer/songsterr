Not quite perfect, but pretty close.\n- Fixed the ending\n- Touched up the bass a little bit, but it could still use some work. I don't think there's so many open strings and some of the fills are incomplete/missing.","createdAt":"2018-06-12T03:59:33.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/37477760.gp5","personId":551392,"person":"Steve","title":"Die With Your Boots On","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":212911,"songId":38574,"description":"Little improvements in intro and first solo","createdAt":"2012-11-26T16:39:37.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/11824003.gp5","personId":468573,"person":"the1f","title":"Die With Your Boots On","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
