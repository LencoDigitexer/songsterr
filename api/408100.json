(just so it isn't silent for 17 measures)\nOverall more refined tab.\nSolo corrected. (Amity's first solo!)\n\nBig thanks to AskingSierra for the previous tab. It was a helpful guideline.\n\nThis can be played in C# Standard if you wish. There's no 0 chugs, and the lowest note used is a C#.\n\nFeel free to add Bass and Drums.","createdAt":"2016-07-22T23:07:58.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/19236516.gp5","personId":708340,"person":"friedpossum","title":"I Bring The Weather With Me","artist":"The Amity Affliction","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
