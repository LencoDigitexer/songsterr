However, tuxguitar, in typical tuxguitar fashion, decided to corrupt and delete my file, so I had to redo it. This time, however, I decided to upload one track at a time just to be safe. So, for this update:\n\n-Completely redid bass. Added the octaver effect (and yes, the bass is normally played in the upper octave with an octave down effect. Just look at any live video and even the music video) and an overdrive effect. The timings and some of the fingerings may be off though, so tell me if I'm wrong.\n\n-Added the crystal track to give the piano that echo-y sound you hear in the song.\n\nThe rest will be up later in one-to-two week increments, although the synth part will take A LOT longer as that was the main reason my original tab took so long. I plan to do the drum track next. Thanks! :)","createdAt":"2016-08-17T19:51:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/19952503.gp5","personId":970727,"person":"Rockn","title":"Starlight","artist":"Muse","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
