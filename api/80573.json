[{"revisionId":352267,"songId":80573,"description":"Fixed bar 59 of lead guitar. Solo is 100% right now, apart from GP's limitations. Bars 46-48 moved from distorted to acoustic guitar. BPM is now 100 instead of 102 (I confirmed this with online sources and by testing the original song in my DAW). Also noticed original file was made by a drummer, so I will trust his judgement on the drums. Pretty good bass tab too. Still not sure if the power chords in bars 49 and 82 are the right chords, and where the hell the acoustic and overdriven guitars should be playing. Banjo looks solid.","createdAt":"2018-04-17T14:05:54.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36690152.gp5","personId":939566,"person":"DL","title":"Fearless","artist":"Taylor Swift","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
