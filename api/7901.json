I added these in Guitar Pro but not sure if that translates to Songsterr.\n- Section markers are back.\n- Bass was good in the previous version, so I left it alone.\n- Added the key change at the start of the solo.\n- BPM is 118.","createdAt":"2019-09-11T15:52:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40034455.gp5","personId":939566,"person":"DL","title":"Stacy's Mom","artist":"Fountains Of Wayne","tracksCount":10,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":327093,"songId":7901,"description":"Added in lead and backup vocals, but it's still missing the lyrics.  Fixed the lead guitar part to match what the live performances sound like.  (Which is fairly close to the studio version as far a guitars go.)  Fixed the drumset part (Hopefully, not familiar with converting GP6 files to GP5) and added member names.  Also added claps to the last chorus.  I don't think the final chorus is quite correct but it's as close as I can get it.","createdAt":"2017-03-08T04:06:49.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24696757.gp5","personId":1196989,"person":"OneManOneBand","title":"Stacy's Mom","artist":"Fountains Of Wayne","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":257089,"songId":7901,"description":"Changed stuff","createdAt":"2015-07-29T18:59:10.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17413282.gp5","personId":808100,"person":"Name","title":"Stacy's Mom","artist":"Fountains Of Wayne","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
