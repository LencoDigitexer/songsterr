[{"revisionId":328112,"songId":56298,"description":"There a too many mistakes on the current tab. The bassline is totally different from the original song, the main riff is slightly different. Also, the  first part of the bridge song is actually an arpeggio and not just two notes, and the second part of the bridge iis played with octaves and not power chords. I think this version I made is much more accurate. I'm a big fan of this song, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks!","createdAt":"2017-04-01T04:45:20.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/25022614.gp5","personId":1215481,"person":"beepstreet","title":"Burning","artist":"The Whitest Boy Alive","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
