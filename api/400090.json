[{"revisionId":340168,"songId":400090,"description":"Added drum track. Should be nearly perfect.\n\nI adjusted the rhythm of the guitar/bass parts since the timing was adjusted to fit the drums. The song starts with a pickup note, but the guitar tabs were written without that, so I had to move everything forward 1 eighth-note, and had to adjust rhythms in the chorus and bridge sections to fit. They may need to be checked again. I modified my MP3 in Audacity to bring out the guitar more to try and get the rhythms correct, but I'm not 100% certain.\n\nI condensed the guitar parts from the unnecessary 4 tracks into 2 tracks, and named all tracks.\n\nNo Vocal track yet.","createdAt":"2017-11-07T07:29:33.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/35940401.gp5","personId":775293,"person":"Maian","title":"1000hp","artist":"Godsmack","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":333369,"songId":400090,"description":"Added Bass","createdAt":"2017-05-26T19:13:28.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/30821389.gp5","personId":1143596,"person":"Jeremy","title":"1000hp","artist":"Godsmack","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":256688,"songId":400090,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2015-07-20T19:20:28.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17391367.gp5","personId":946910,"person":"Pedro Henrique","title":"1000hp","artist":"Godsmack","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
