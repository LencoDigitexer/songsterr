Furthermore, Alvin also removed the legato tapping part in the lead guitar. The extra instruments that Alvin added are perfectly okay, though. I only wish he added the rhythm guitar and the lead guitar as they were before he added the intro to the song."}],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":479502,"songId":463972,"description":"Added intro and drums","createdAt":"2022-02-06T04:41:31.251Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49010248.gp5","personId":2332914,"person":"WinnieTheShoeh","title":"Stabbing In The Dark","artist":"Ice Nine Kills","tracksCount":14,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":400114,"songId":463972,"description":"Touched up the legato/tapping part in the intro.","createdAt":"2020-04-04T10:17:41.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41709219.gp5","personId":1190923,"person":"Alvin Karlsson","title":"Stabbing In The Dark","artist":"Ice Nine Kills","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":400113,"songId":463972,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2020-04-04T09:11:32.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41709121.gp5","personId":1190923,"person":"Alvin Karlsson","title":"Stabbing In The Dark","artist":"Ice Nine Kills","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
