[{"revisionId":224670,"songId":19434,"description":"The main difference here is the addition of 3 guitars. But don't panic! They are all needed for the song to be complete, and one of them is an All-In-One track, so you won't have to switch tracks while playing the song. Added palm mutes to the guitars, added markers, fixed volumes. Some changes in all tracks, mostly the drums.","createdAt":"2013-07-17T17:19:41.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/14708998.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Violent Pornography","artist":"System of a Down","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
