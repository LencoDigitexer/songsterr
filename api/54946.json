Anyway, I fixed basically everything. The tab isn't impossible to read, and it actually sounds the like the song. There are probably some problems with drums and bass though, it's really fuckin' hard to hear either in the song, so just take it as you will. Other than that, the solo's a bit dodgy and I probably missed a few other things. I'll fix it later, though. Also, the volumes might be all off and whatnot. If that's the case, then sorry, I have no control over that.","createdAt":"2015-06-10T08:03:24.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/16263175.gp5","personId":976871,"person":"B98V","title":"Trogdor","artist":"Strong Bad","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
