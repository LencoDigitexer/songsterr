Because on the tracks you can hear the pick attacking the string every quarter note, don't change this because he plays it live like that too. We have the stems and it sounds like how I tabbed it.\nAlso fixed main bridge and added the slide that is both also played live and on the studio recording\nPut the Solo in Kirk's track and Moved James' solos from Kirk's track to James track\nFixed bass overfilling measures sometimes\nFixed bridge. Do NOT use grace notes, they don't work with Songsterr.\nFixed verse riff, and now it's how they play it on the Studio and live version (they play the live and the studio regardless, it's just that kirk changes up the solo)\nChanged Chorus the correct tabbing, and also how it is played on James guitar\nIn the studio, there's two James guitars playing the same riff but different ways. The main chorus riff is on James guitar and the other way to play it is on the James Extras track\nFixed the extras outro too, it had grace notes so yea","createdAt":"2021-09-05T16:19:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/46944448.gp5","personId":1900642,"person":"Clay","title":"King Nothing","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":416221,"songId":12147,"description":"fixed an error in the bass.","createdAt":"2020-09-14T04:18:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43207540.gp5","personId":1747823,"person":"Weston","title":"King Nothing","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":405734,"songId":12147,"description":"fixed the bass, and added an octave to the intro as is heard in the song.","createdAt":"2020-05-30T01:13:09.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42230560.gp5","personId":1747823,"person":"Weston","title":"King Nothing","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":403654,"songId":12147,"description":"changed the bridge to overdrive.","createdAt":"2020-05-08T08:06:06.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42014444.gp5","personId":1747823,"person":"Weston","title":"King Nothing","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":377741,"songId":12147,"description":"Slowed down the tempo","createdAt":"2019-06-15T18:28:58.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39548589.gp5","personId":1457061,"person":"BlueMercury","title":"King Nothing","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":248557,"songId":12147,"description":"Added track names","createdAt":"2015-01-09T19:44:27.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15944123.gp5","personId":536932,"person":"Michael Finnie","title":"King Nothing","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
