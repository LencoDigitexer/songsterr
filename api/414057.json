[{"revisionId":604746,"songId":414057,"description":"After playing the descending arpeggio at bar 34, the 10th fret D string is played with the pinky; it's then easier to keep hand in same position and use index finger to play 6th fret D rather than shift hand and play 11th fret A string with pinky to follow up with 10th fret ring finger and 8th fret index. Also means next bar, 35 maintains same hand position from bar 34.\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-08-12T07:21:35.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/58835911.gp","personId":2689789,"person":"Zakary","title":"Giant Steps","artist":"John Coltrane","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":282516,"songId":414057,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2016-10-14T11:42:28.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/20669331.gp5","personId":755000,"person":"Dmitry Enikeev","title":"Giant Steps","artist":"John Coltrane","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
