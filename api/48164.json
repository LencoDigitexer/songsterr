[{"revisionId":485038,"songId":48164,"description":"The song is in standard D, not drop D.\nAdded some slides to the main riff, chorus riff, and in the breakdown part.\nThe chorus riff is straight single 32nd notes, no power chords or other rhythm.\nThere are some pauses before the choruses where they just hold the E5. \nBreakdown riff had missing palm mutes.\nRight before the chorus riff during the solo riff, It sounds like there is another pause but they play an open D note right before it goes into the chorus.\n----\nWesterband LOVES Nailbomb","createdAt":"2022-03-16T17:04:21.705Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49548277.gp5","personId":1233597,"person":"Joseph","title":"Wasting Away","artist":"Nailbomb","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":302760,"songId":48164,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2016-11-05T06:45:27.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/23290477.gp5","personId":145787,"person":"Leonard","title":"Wasting Away","artist":"Nailbomb","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
