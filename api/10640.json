I now have approximately 6 times more guitar experience than I did when I submitted my previous revision of this song (I'll let you do the math). I have fixed many, many things:\n- Fixed rhythmic error during the re-intro (the third hit is now on the upbeat of beat 4)\n- Fixed the lyrics (no more of \"THE LAW BREAKING! THE LAW BREAKING!\")\n- Corrected the vocal melody\n- Correction to the main riff (open A string changed to 5th fret of E string, as seen in live videos)\n- Moved C power chord during the pre-chorus to be rooted one string higher (as seen in live videos)\n- The slide hits during the chorus were changed to be one string lower (as seen in live videos)\n- Fixed rhythmic errors during the bridge\n- Reworked the ending; there are now 4 guitars\n- Corrections to the bass part\n- Reverted drums to the 2015 version, with some slight improvements","createdAt":"2018-07-16T02:05:59.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/37657999.gp5","personId":551392,"person":"Steve","title":"Breaking The Law","artist":"Judas Priest","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":333834,"songId":10640,"description":"Fixed some of the errors which were pointed out\n\nSince I use TuxGuitar I couldn't fix the vocals","createdAt":"2017-06-07T03:35:39.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/31890385.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Breaking The Law","artist":"Judas Priest","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
