[{"revisionId":570068,"songId":527071,"description":"Includes all instuments: 4 electric guitars (2 lead, 2 rhythm), 3 acoustic guitars (1 lead, 2 rhythm), bass, drums, 2 synths (second is for the beginning only, for a darker sound), viola (only one playing multiple notes at once to reduce the total number of tracks in Guitar Pro). I isolated the parts of the original song via AudioStrip and transcribed of each part by ear, and compared with the original song just in case. Advising to use the Guitar Pro file for practical and sound reason.","createdAt":"2023-05-06T20:15:30.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56853180.gp","personId":1068048,"person":"Electric Mami","title":"Schadenfreude","artist":"Dir En Grey","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":530990,"songId":527071,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2022-12-12T12:10:13.918Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/53909558.gp5","personId":1206378,"person":"Bogdan Csaba","title":"Schadenfreude","artist":"Dir En Grey","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
