[{"revisionId":242256,"songId":19722,"description":"Slowed down just a touch, 140bpm to 137. I am almost certain the song is 137-138. Bass tab completely reworked. The original is actually a quarter-step sharp, but I don't think this can be applied in Guitar Pro.","createdAt":"2014-08-12T23:26:08.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15619735.gp5","personId":24552,"person":"Andrew","title":"867-5309 Jenny","artist":"Tommy Tutone","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
