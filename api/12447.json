[{"revisionId":588184,"songId":12447,"description":"The B in measure 180 played on (currently notated as on the 7th string) should be played on the 8th string due to the fingering pattern. Inversely, the same B in measure 182 (currently notated on the 1st string) should be played on the 7th string...again, fingering pattern. Both prevent a tendon-tweaking stretch...ESPECIALLY if have medium size hands or smaller and are playing on a 29.4\" scale guitar. (As far as I can tell the same riff is correct in the rest of the tab)\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-06-30T04:26:33.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/57878628.gp","personId":2610108,"person":"Chalz","title":"In Death - Is Death","artist":"Meshuggah","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":414513,"songId":12447,"description":"corrected tempo","createdAt":"2020-08-26T22:58:30.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43047920.gp5","personId":1879654,"person":"Juan Alfaro","title":"In Death - Is Death","artist":"Meshuggah","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":261583,"songId":12447,"description":"Added bass and more guitars.","createdAt":"2015-11-28T01:08:33.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17688579.gp5","personId":839858,"person":"Manu","title":"In Death - Is Death","artist":"Meshuggah","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
