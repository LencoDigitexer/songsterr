Jacob, I don't even know what you're doing, simplifying the bass part? It was right before, I tabbed it from the stems and to be honest as a bassist myself I'm a little bit offended by your desire to make my part even easier. I'll post another revision later to fix up everything else, but this is just basically my revision from way back when.","createdAt":"2019-09-22T08:19:29.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40096719.gp5","personId":1241428,"person":"hello","title":"It's Only Smiles","artist":"Periphery","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":383544,"songId":451250,"description":"Cleaned up the bass part.","createdAt":"2019-09-22T03:31:14.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40096279.gp5","personId":1109762,"person":"Jacob","title":"It's Only Smiles","artist":"Periphery","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":381878,"songId":451250,"description":"Fixed a few of the rhythm guitar parts.
