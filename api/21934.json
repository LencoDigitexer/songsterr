I added a ton of missed palm mutes to the main riff.\n2. I changed some of the tabs to the same notes, but much simpler and easier to play. They make more sense the other way as well.\n3. The intro and outro acoustic guitar had a very subtle hammer on and pull off, so I added that.\n4. When I downloaded the GP file, there were a bunch of notes that songsterr didn't have because of the missing functionality, so I manually reprogrammed those notes.\n5. Changed the sound effect of the swelling bass to a cello, as that is what most people seem to identify it as at first.\n6. Added some more descriptive text.\n7.
