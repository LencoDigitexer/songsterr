There was a mistake in the very first verse (not d-b-g but rather d-e-g). The chorus was missing the chromatic descending riff sometimes. Verse and Chorus was notated oddly and was hard to read. I didn't change it but made it easier to read by using appropriate sixteenth notes and ties. The original transcriber has two C#'s on the hold (1...2....3...!) but I can't hear that. I left it in though. A lot of vibratos but I've never seen him do a vibrato. It sounds like a slight bend (in the verse) instead (on the 5th fret A).","createdAt":"2020-01-16T19:13:18.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41045545.gp5","personId":1950831,"person":"Chris","title":"Bombtrack","artist":"Rage Against The Machine","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":380131,"songId":461,"description":"Cleaned up rhythm guitar section, corrected solo, made some corrections to all guitar parts, minor corrections for drums and bass during the Bridge.","createdAt":"2019-07-29T04:01:07.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39779545.gp5","personId":1764730,"person":"Timobkg","title":"Bombtrack","artist":"Rage Against The Machine","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":261221,"songId":461,"description":"Minor changes","createdAt":"2015-11-18T03:50:59.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17652329.gp5","personId":636589,"person":"Majstru","title":"Bombtrack","artist":"Rage Against The Machine","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
