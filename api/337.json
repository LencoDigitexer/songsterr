Changed P.M. chords to 2 strings for more accurate and less cluttered sound. Rewrote Lead guitar 2 so hopefully no more weird error messages. Reorganized lead/harmony guitar notation, took out useless rests, small volume fixes. Still 3 guitars in this tab; that's not changing!","createdAt":"2013-11-06T02:18:50.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/14969710.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Rock You Like A Hurricane","artist":"Scorpions","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
