The steal string was meant to be plucked. As for the hand positioning, you only slide down the neck twice in the 1st and 33rd measure, showing Rad probably doesn't understand the hand postioning, given the previous how unless you have big hands, you have to slide your hands to reach the  --7-9-10   in the 7th  measure.\n                            6--------\nIf you check out every other version of this song ever, you will find it to be played on the top 3 strings. \n\nHere is my revision to them both. Reduced the hammer-ons, added the ones that were missed, replaced the missing note, and reverting it to the authentic composition.","createdAt":"2016-11-15T00:39:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/23575761.gp5","personId":1165151,"person":"Mandolore","title":"Gerudo Valley","artist":"The Legend Of Zelda","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":312541,"songId":43855,"description":"All kadkal did was introduce errors such as missing notes and loose sustain. He also moved most of the riffs to the top 3 strings, showing he doesn't understand the hand positioning required to play the full range required by this song without rapidly shifting up and down the neck. What he meant by making it \"not be needlessly complicated\" was to remove all hammer-ons and pull-offs I've noted on the tab - so his revision notes are a little misleading. Here is a revert to my version, with some volume adjustments to make it easier to hear on Songsterr's soundbank.","createdAt":"2016-11-14T19:26:39.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/23569100.gp5","personId":60714,"person":"Rad Dlugowski","title":"Gerudo Valley","artist":"The Legend Of Zelda","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":312458,"songId":43855,"description":"Redid the tab to not be needlessly complicated.","createdAt":"2016-11-13T22:14:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/23545747.gp5","personId":953059,"person":"kadkal","title":"Gerudo Valley","artist":"The Legend Of Zelda","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":275617,"songId":43855,"description":"Redid the entire tab from scratch by ear.
