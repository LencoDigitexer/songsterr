[{"revisionId":615472,"songId":90561,"description":"I changed the open D string to the 5th fret on the A string.  It's a much more smooth octave, and it provides the sliding sound back and forth from note to note.  Don't have to play open D and mute, then next note on 7th fret... Fingers never have to leave the fretboard.
