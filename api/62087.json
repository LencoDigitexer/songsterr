[{"revisionId":231886,"songId":62087,"description":"Fixed bass: changed to pick, moved all notes down to the D string, removed palm mutes, fixed chorus. Fixed guitars: added hammer-ons, vibratos, slides, and other nuances, fixed pre-chorus and chorus. Maxed bass drum volume. Added vocals and backing vocals with lyrics, including the screaming parts, so mute them if you want.","createdAt":"2013-12-25T00:18:47.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15078555.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Knives And Pens (EP Version)","artist":"Black Veil Brides","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
