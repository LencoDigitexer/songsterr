The song is played in D minor, but Jimmy Page uses vari-speed to lower this down to C# minor, therefor making the strings in the tab down a half step.  So technically, the numbers on the tablature are correct.  Fingerings are the same for the live editions (with the exception of the strings being tuned standard, as live versions are a half step higher than the studio).  This is definitely correct.","createdAt":"2014-06-29T05:45:31.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15504621.gp3","personId":823419,"person":"Anthony Speciale","title":"No Quarter","artist":"Led Zeppelin","tracksCount":11,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
