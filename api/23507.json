Also I know nothing of drums and bass, so no further changes were made there.\nAs for solo harmonies, I found the tab here (https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bullet_for_my_valentine/waking_the_demon_tabs_837045), and it sounds fine to me. The harmonies in measures 96 and 98, as a comment stated, I couldn't find, so I wasn't able to add those.","createdAt":"2019-01-11T09:26:11.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/38667817.gp5","personId":1541714,"person":"Steven Heinen","title":"Waking The Demon","artist":"Bullet For My Valentine","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":335371,"songId":23507,"description":"The corrections in this version basically are: the correction of certain parts in the guitars, both the one that was changed by the one that teaches Michael Padge in Youtube and some fragments that did not go in the respective guitar ...
