I Replaced some of the crash cymbals to open hi-hat because the open hi-hat sounds better & the previous constant crash cymbals were way too loud and dominating over the snare.

Kept the E standard tuned tracks because it's still possible to play the song note for note in E standard. C# tracks have the riffs at 119 and 193 in different positions, which should be how Tony originally seems to play them live.\n- Simplified the main riff so the power chord doesn't gradually remove notes.\n- Added palm mutes to the section at 191 and fixed a note in the riff at 193.\n- Corrections to bass track\n- Corrected some lyrics and aligned them with the vocal track properly\n- Put the solo in its own track and put the rhythm part during the solo in the rhythm track\n- Added swing to 191 - 216\n- Minor changes to the lead and vocal tracks\n- Put the acoustic part that was in the previous overdub distortion track into its own nylon acoustic track\n- Added chord names","createdAt":"2020-08-17T00:39:55.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42949810.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Symptom of the Universe","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":409785,"songId":2854,"description":"changed bpm slightly, changed a few parts with the bass.","createdAt":"2020-07-11T20:45:09.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42606607.gp5","personId":1747823,"person":"Weston","title":"Symptom of the Universe","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":376432,"songId":2854,"description":"Removed annoying palm mute text and changed the solo so it should stay in the same position throughout most of it.","createdAt":"2019-05-23T02:20:24.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39424961.gp5","personId":1548560,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Symptom of the Universe","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":264912,"songId":2854,"description":"Added lyrics & sections; added actual palm mutes, not just text.","createdAt":"2016-02-15T01:05:54.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/18127075.gp5","personId":897080,"person":"EzraBlumenfeld","title":"Symptom of the Universe","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
