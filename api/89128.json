That being said, I have never even played guitar, so some parts might (and most likely do) have a more practical way of being played.\nI will naturally make corrections if need be.\n\nNote: I created the tab using TuxGuitar and converting the TG file to GP5 spawned a few unwanted changes... I will try to come up with a solution to that ASAP.","createdAt":"2022-03-31T21:14:34.503Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49713021.gp5","personId":2358442,"person":"Ephemeral","title":"Lullaby","artist":"Low","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":381382,"songId":89128,"description":"Much much better","createdAt":"2019-08-18T13:11:52.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39889746.gp5","personId":1722187,"person":"Bora Boyacıoğlu","title":"Lullaby","artist":"Low","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":174580,"songId":89128,"description":"Muuch better.","createdAt":"2012-03-08T22:53:16.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/11434185.gp5","personId":215382,"person":"Saytun","title":"Lullaby","artist":"Low","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
