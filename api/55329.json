[{"revisionId":351264,"songId":55329,"description":"This tab has a number of things that the previous one was lacking. In the whole song, there are six guitars (4 clean, 2 distortion). The Interlude is using clean over-dubbed guitars in which i have taken in the liberty of tabbing out all guitars using  the \"Hal Leonard- Hypnotize\" system of a down book for all to see. I have also added the guitars in the pre-chorus that make that melodious sound that also wasn't in the previous tab. I also cannot stress that enough, that Shavo plays similar to Daron in the riff when the bass kicks in. Guitars were tabbed using the book, and bass and drums were tabbed using ear.","createdAt":"2018-04-17T13:47:23.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36684999.gp5","personId":94011,"person":"Carlos298711","title":"Tentative","artist":"System of a Down","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
