[{"revisionId":416326,"songId":459246,"description":"Adjusted the types of harmonics, as regardless of what they sound like, Pinch harmonics are what they actually are.  Artificial harmonics are different from pinch harmonics.  Thank you for fixing the volumes though.  Feel free to adjust that next time you find one of my tabs' sound (one of the cons of exporting to gp5 is that it screws with the track volumes.), but do not change anything else, as all notes and techniques are 100% correct.  Good day sir.","createdAt":"2020-09-15T06:50:45.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43219526.gp5","personId":1590164,"person":"Lucas Bozovich","title":"The Adversary","artist":"Thy Art Is Murder","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":416263,"songId":459246,"description":"correct volumes","createdAt":"2020-09-14T17:20:25.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43214256.gp5","personId":681649,"person":"invader_invader","title":"The Adversary","artist":"Thy Art Is Murder","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":390568,"songId":459246,"description":"Fixed an error on Gary Markowski measures 80 and 82.","createdAt":"2019-12-13T06:45:42.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40790034.gp5","personId":1590164,"person":"Lucas Bozovich","title":"The Adversary","artist":"Thy Art Is Murder","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":390566,"songId":459246,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2019-12-13T04:25:17.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40789788.gp5","personId":1590164,"person":"Lucas Bozovich","title":"The Adversary","artist":"Thy Art Is Murder","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
