Horrible doesn't even BEGIN to describe your fucking tab. Full of wrong notes, wrong time signatures, wrong ones, wrong drum notation, AND ADDED PARTS THAT ARE NOT EVEN IN THE SONG!! I have to say this is probably the worst tab I have ever come across on this fucking site. If this is the quality that is being condoned here, then fuck this entire place. If you would've only fucked up in the solo part, I wouldn't have blamed you honestly, because that solo is fucking crazy. BUT STILL! HAVE SOME FUCKING DECENCY TO AT LEAST GET SOMETHING RIGHT! Jesus fuck... tone deaf motherfucker. EVERYTHING WAS FIXED! Starting from the intro ALL THE WAY to the outro. I didn't bother touching the solos though, except the unison one. I'll leave that to someone else. There is no keyboard solo still.","createdAt":"2017-03-27T10:45:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24798773.gp5","personId":951097,"person":"Shadows","title":"Triple Corpse Hammerblow","artist":"Children Of Bodom","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":294136,"songId":5054,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2016-10-31T10:05:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/22874239.gp4","personId":33,"person":"Leland","title":"Triple Corpse Hammerblow","artist":"Children Of Bodom","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
