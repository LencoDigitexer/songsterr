If you're using a lot of dotted quarters or quarter-eighth patterns in 6/8 or 12/8 it's probably 4/4 with swing/shuffle)\r\n\r\n- Positionings for things have been changed to make more sense, as well as be more accurate to what's seen in live recordings (incomplete; biggest changes in the bridge/outro)\r\n- Some tracks have been merged. May not be permanent, I'll take a closer look at the song some other time and see what should be done\r\n- Added lead sheet symbols pretty much everywhere they're needed\r\n- Correrctions to drums here and there, as well as a few other tracks. Still needs work","createdAt":"2023-02-10T06:56:02.143Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55213749.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Spring and a Storm","artist":"Tally Hall","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":514856,"songId":500524,"description":"Added repeats to the beginning guitar line.
