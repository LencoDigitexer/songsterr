Every song in existence could be in 4/4 if you don't count the beats. The time signatures used were a conscious choice to reflect emphasis of particular notes, repetition of certain riffs and to avoid having too many tied notes in between bars, actually making it easier to read. Having alternating time signatures is not a new or unusual concept in progressive metal (Schism by Tool is a great example). I also use 8/8 instead of 4/4 to make it easier to count these bars amongst the 7/8 and 9/8 bars."}],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":447544,"songId":486702,"description":"Version 2: separate clean guitar tracks added.
