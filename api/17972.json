[{"revisionId":228993,"songId":17972,"description":"THERE IS NO \"N\" IN \"RHYTHM\" COME ON NOW. FIXED SPELLING OF \"RHYTHM\". Used 3 note power chords instead of 2. Not quite sure how you can hammer-on from an open to a closed hi-hat O_o so I got rid of that. Fixed notation in all tracks (which was particularly ugly at the end) to make the tab readable and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.","createdAt":"2013-10-21T15:21:20.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/14920431.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Bite To Break Skin","artist":"Senses Fail","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
