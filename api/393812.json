I request to have the previous version up for just a day or two more! I've almost learned the whole thing.\n\nIf there's any way you can unblock the tab but still keep the same tab, that would be ideal for guitar players (i humbly request you, satjeevan, to keep this version for a little while longer. Also, I can play the tab on my mobile device, so I don't see how the tab is locked..? But please, do consider this for the time being.)","createdAt":"2015-01-30T00:50:04.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15754372.gp5","personId":921479,"person":"john smith","title":"Thinking Out Loud","artist":"Ed Sheeran","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
