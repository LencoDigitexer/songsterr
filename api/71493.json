[{"revisionId":259323,"songId":71493,"description":"Cleaned up the drum track and fixed a few errors and volumes. It should be good-to-go, but there's always one measure I leave out when I fix them.\n\nAdded band names to the guitar parts, and fixed the Bass player's name (Bob Kakaha didn't join until after Monsanto was kicked out at the launch party, so Monsanto recorded these parts on the album - Bob Zilla just played the tour). I think I got the guitar parts right, though. I based it off of which one plays the part at measure 11 (in live recordings I found, it's Greg Tribbett).\n\nThere were 8 extra measures towards the end that I removed as well.","createdAt":"2015-09-18T22:25:19.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17538413.gp5","personId":775293,"person":"Maian","title":"Hellyeah","artist":"Hellyeah","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
