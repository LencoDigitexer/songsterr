Now you have a clean electric, nylon acoustic, and steel acoustic track. I also added in some notes on how you can accomplish this live without extra guitarists. Only 2 guitar/bass tracks are ever playing at the same time, so if your bassist can use an extra onstage guitar or a 6 string guitar equipped with a GK3 for their bass tones (which would be ideal, since you'd want synth bass tones for this song) they can use the GK3 or a piezo pickup for acoustic tones and play the chorus parts. The nylon parts can be played by the guitarist by switching to a piezo pickup. Which of the two plays the acoustic and the nylon parts can also be switched, if you'd rather have the bassist cover the nylon parts and the guitarist the steel acoustic parts.","createdAt":"2017-01-03T12:21:09.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24474849.gp5","personId":60714,"person":"Rad Dlugowski","title":"Feel Good Inc.","artist":"Gorillaz","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":324663,"songId":549,"description":"Oops, missed one spot in the rap vocals.","createdAt":"2017-01-03T11:53:33.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24474603.gp5","personId":60714,"person":"Rad Dlugowski","title":"Feel Good Inc.","artist":"Gorillaz","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":324662,"songId":549,"description":"Updated rap vocals instrument, tempo, and attempted to fix the pad glitch with the Songsterr soundbank.","createdAt":"2017-01-03T11:19:20.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24474426.gp5","personId":60714,"person":"Rad Dlugowski","title":"Feel Good Inc.","artist":"Gorillaz","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":324661,"songId":549,"description":"Fixed the bass mistakes and octave, fixed the guitar (it is supposed to be a D# arpeggio over D#m, listen to the studio version carefully), added in lyrics, named all the instruments after the Gorillaz members (as per request in the comment section), added in proper score information, and a few others.
