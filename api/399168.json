The unnecessary and dumb jumps from 6 to 4, even to 3 string, this bullshit doesn't even match the official cover from the band member (reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KhSf72hxT4). It's uncomfortable to play with downstroke too, which was also used by official band members during their tours and composing.
