[{"revisionId":344333,"songId":23778,"description":"Fixed a few wrong notes in the bass part.\n\nDuring the verse there are 2 bars where Tim ends the bars on a D/E respectively... the original tab started those bars on a B: those bars clearly start on an A! (the 5th up from B).\n\nDuring the last bar of the bridge, the original tab only had the bass playing a D... it's a D / E 4 times.\n\nBefore the big ending, Tim plays D B D B... The last B is an octave up. Fixed.","createdAt":"2018-02-05T15:35:58.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36320622.gp5","personId":1276872,"person":"Nolan Venhola","title":"Gasoline","artist":"Audioslave","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":33708,"songId":23778,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2009-07-01T16:39:12.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/3640193.gp3","personId":145787,"person":"Leonard","title":"Gasoline","artist":"Audioslave","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
