[{"revisionId":245200,"songId":5934,"description":"Major bass revision: fixed the bass rhythm, marked the ghost notes, fixed an issue with a bar that doesn't exist in the actual song (bar 64 in the previous version).  Added section names and timing markers.  The only thing I didn't do to the bass line was to add the staccatos...there are just too many.  It's up to the individual player to interpret them as he/she wishes.","createdAt":"2014-10-25T14:28:21.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15782391.gp5","personId":153820,"person":"FerK","title":"Girls On Film","artist":"Duran Duran","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
