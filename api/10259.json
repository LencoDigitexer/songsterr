Throughout the song, the hi-hat is only on the downbeat. \r\n- Lukather's harmonic whammy dip starts a measure early.\r\n- Lukather's part during measures 19 to 22 has been rewritten to be on the G & B string, not the A, D & G string for ease of play. \r\n- Adlibs during the song have been added (Such as \"Ooh!\" and \"Brrrrrt!\" throughout).\r\n- Eddie's solo's pick-slide has been fixed.\r\n- Various tweaks, fixes, and improvements otherwise.","createdAt":"2023-01-06T18:52:06.298Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/54478304.gp5","personId":2430582,"person":"Hayaat","title":"Beat It","artist":"Michael Jackson","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":530736,"songId":10259,"description":"transposed song sounds better in tuxguitar, but awful in  songsterr, so, back to previous version....","createdAt":"2022-12-10T14:04:03.464Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/53886904.gp5","personId":1983505,"person":"Stephan","title":"Beat It","artist":"Michael Jackson","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":530720,"songId":10259,"description":"Just transposed to drop D Bass","createdAt":"2022-12-10T11:59:01.034Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/53885592.gp5","personId":1983505,"person":"Stephan","title":"Beat It","artist":"Michael Jackson","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":448504,"songId":10259,"description":"- Added vocal harmonies","createdAt":"2021-07-03T01:48:33.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/46172456.gp5","personId":1111148,"person":"BelovedProblemChild","title":"Beat It","artist":"Michael Jackson","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":447765,"songId":10259,"description":"- Fixed P.
