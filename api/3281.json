Here's what's done: Fixed markers. Corrected tempo. Doubled tempo for more convenient reading. Some fixes in bass. Reorganization and some fixes in drums, which may not yet be 100% accurate. Redid the four vocal tracks (which were an octave too high) and added lyrics to all. Complete guitar overhaul, including correct tuning. Corrected the ending with the fade out.","createdAt":"2013-04-23T22:20:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/12047929.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Feeling This","artist":"Blink-182","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
