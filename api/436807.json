While the \"Clean\" guitar track isn't really accurate, it provides an adequate backing for the other tracks.\n- Added all guitar harmonies.\n- Fixed timing on just about everything. While some places could be a little more accurate, it is close enough to the original so as to not be jarring.\n- Most importantly, corrected all wrong notes, added missing notes, and made it closer to how Marty plays it in many areas for those who care. Where I haven't given a part that treatment, again, I made sure the notes were at least correct.","createdAt":"2017-12-19T14:20:11.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36104419.gp5","personId":1342417,"person":"Luke","title":"Whiteworm","artist":"Marty Friedman","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":341067,"songId":436807,"description":"i think latin interlude is out of tempo","createdAt":"2017-11-29T16:16:38.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36027103.gp4","personId":1409575,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Whiteworm","artist":"Marty Friedman","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":338605,"songId":436807,"description":"Added leads during some sections","createdAt":"2017-09-28T21:00:22.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/35527155.gp5","personId":914365,"person":"ple","title":"Whiteworm","artist":"Marty Friedman","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":338596,"songId":436807,"description":"Fix some rhythm areas, timing.
