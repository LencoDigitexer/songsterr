Measure 102) Play notes distinctly. Listen to the recording to get a better feel of the short rests/stops and staccato like picking. I’m guessing Page played this loosely on stage.

The bass, solo and fills overdriven guitar, and drum tracks have not been changed from the 6/30/2009 version by ruvik or the 3/13/20 version by Jax Joke. I used the 1993 Remaster as the reference recording; and used on-line tutorials (available on YouTube as of 03/21/2020) from Howard Hart, Las Vegas Guitar, GuitarLessons365Song and James James. I reworked the intro, verse and chorus parts up to measure #120. Some of the notes from the original ruvik TAB were simply wrong; I think the bends and the harmonic overtones can really trick the ear. The update by Jax Joke fixed some of that; however, I felt more could be done. I think the tutorials from Howard Heart and Las Vegas Guitar are more accurate for this particular track. Basically, what I did was make mods to this TAB based on their TABS, then listened to the remaster to make sure as best possible that what I was writing was accurate.","createdAt":"2020-03-31T19:50:08.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/41672387.gp5","personId":1495432,"person":"Peter Smith","title":"The Rover","artist":"Led Zeppelin","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":397983,"songId":23764,"description":"It should be good.. not my tab..
