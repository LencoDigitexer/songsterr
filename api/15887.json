[{"revisionId":223604,"songId":15887,"description":"Got rid of the stupid 16th rests in the drums. Changed some notation in the vocals. Removed the backup vocals by combining it into the background vocals. Added chord names to guitar 3. Rewrote guitar 4 by moving the power chords up a string instead of up the neck. Fixed volume.","createdAt":"2013-06-24T01:39:25.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/14196677.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Free Fallin'","artist":"Tom Petty","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
