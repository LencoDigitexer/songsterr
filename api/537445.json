[{"revisionId":551984,"songId":537445,"description":"My version of the tab which coincidentally I made the same day as the initial revision of this was uploaded, without knowing this version existed. Anyways, time signatures are different, the lead guitar is more accurate but not finished or perfect. Rhythm is much closer to the song. All of this was done by ear using the official instrumental. No drums. Use this as a base for improvement.","createdAt":"2023-03-04T08:44:43.627Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55645102.gp5","personId":1973462,"person":"Mr 420Impeller","title":"Dead Ended","artist":"Kevin Sherwood","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":551632,"songId":537445,"description":"Lead parts were on the wrong strings for some reason, fixed","createdAt":"2023-03-02T21:21:44.708Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55617803.gp5","personId":2459980,"person":"Ashlyn","title":"Dead Ended","artist":"Kevin Sherwood","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":551628,"songId":537445,"description":"Added lead. Definitely won't be adding drums myself (not a drummer, I know next to nothing about drums), bass seems to mostly just follow the rhythm guitar besides when the guitars cut out during the chorus and during the bridge. That said, I can't for the life of me figure out what the bass is playing during the bridge, so I probably won't be adding it myself either.","createdAt":"2023-03-02T21:08:09.448Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55617482.gp5","personId":2459980,"person":"Ashlyn","title":"Dead Ended","artist":"Kevin Sherwood","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":551619,"songId":537445,"description":"Apparently GP5s don't play nice with 8-strings, so here's a 7-string version. The tab's still really rough, lots of BPM and meter changes that probably don't make sense, the chords during the bridge definitely aren't just straight 8th notes, and the weird inverted chords separate the verses and choruses probably aren't right. Overall, there's a lot to do, but this is a good starting point.","createdAt":"2023-03-02T20:56:34.198Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55616984.gp5","personId":2459980,"person":"Ashlyn","title":"Dead Ended","artist":"Kevin Sherwood","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":551608,"songId":537445,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2023-03-02T20:31:33.656Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/55616008.gp5","personId":2459980,"person":"Ashlyn","title":"Dead Ended","artist":"Kevin Sherwood","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
