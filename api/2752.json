I feel like it's better to have them both in the same track, even if it doesn't necessarily sound right, because, if not, it may lead people to believe that the two parts were recorded separately, when they were not.

I believe both it and the opening riff are on the exact same track and there weren't any overdubs or anything.\n- Removed everything from measures 70-107 from the overdub (now named rhythm) guitar track. The bass seems to be slightly overdriven in that section, but it's definitely not guitar.\n- Corrected what the drum track does at measures 65-71\n- Corrected tempo changes near the bridge section\n- Added a tempo change at 108\n- Removed the major third (fourth fret G string) and the D (third fret B string) from the chords from measure 108 to the end of the song. I couldn't hear those notes at all in those sections, and it doesn't make a lot of sense for a G major to be in this song, as it's in G minor.\n- Added chord symbols for the end","createdAt":"2020-12-28T21:29:31.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44217183.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Black Sabbath","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":425270,"songId":2752,"description":"Added clean guitar for verses","createdAt":"2020-12-07T20:55:55.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44043098.gp5","personId":1785328,"person":"B9nny R4bbit","title":"Black Sabbath","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":324725,"songId":2752,"description":"Some minor notation improvements","createdAt":"2017-01-04T05:51:46.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24480664.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Black Sabbath","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":264016,"songId":2752,"description":"Changed trills to actually play in Songsterr","createdAt":"2016-01-26T03:55:34.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17986285.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Black Sabbath","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
