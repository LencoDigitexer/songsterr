I also cleaned up the track names and added clean guitars and more keyboard tracks as nessecary. Because of that I needed to merge two of the vocals tracks together so Songsterr can play every track. \n\nI also moved most of the guitar parts into the tracks labelled \"8-String\", with separate solo tracks for when the higher strings are used. This may make learning the song a little annoying, but I can't think of any other resolution for 8-string guitars.","createdAt":"2017-06-10T04:42:00.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/31905239.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Cockroach King","artist":"Haken","tracksCount":14,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":260176,"songId":392493,"description":"Old file is not working.","createdAt":"2015-10-14T19:30:05.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17588430.gp5","personId":1021967,"person":"Max","title":"Cockroach King","artist":"Haken","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
