[{"revisionId":491136,"songId":16258,"description":"Revised entire song and corrected chord progressions and other instrumentation, as seen live. Added names for tracks, simplified some instrument tracks, made it easier to read, added labels for verse/chorus etc. This should be almost 100% correct. Minus some vocal melodies and some instrument and vocal layers, but the main instruments and chords are correct.","createdAt":"2022-04-28T22:42:36.163Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/50057095.gp5","personId":683498,"person":"WaftyGrowler17","title":"Swing Life Away","artist":"Rise Against","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":312134,"songId":16258,"description":"Aaron's revision removed a large chunk of the song, because that version is the Punk Goes Acoustic version. That version is shorter and does not have the bridge/solo. I am restoring to the Siren Song of the Counter Culture version, which is the longer version with the bridge/solo and the one that people are more familiar with.","createdAt":"2016-11-06T08:58:35.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/23327118.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Swing Life Away","artist":"Rise Against","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
