Playing it as low 5/higher 6 is correct and certainly more practical, but I changed it because this is the way Waters actually plays it (as seen in the official video).\n- Added a slide to the pre-chorus high part. Probably sounds like shit on Songsterr, but there is very clearly a slide in the original song. \nThings to work on next include:\n- Adding vocals\n- Fixing dynamics\n- Minor tempo errors","createdAt":"2022-01-28T19:57:33.526Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/48888514.gp5","personId":2240565,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Alison Hell","artist":"Annihilator","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":473676,"songId":25444,"description":"Intro Fixed","createdAt":"2021-12-30T16:13:34.917Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/48449594.gp5","personId":2181720,"person":"marikkk","title":"Alison Hell","artist":"Annihilator","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":465083,"songId":25444,"description":"Fixed the pre-chorus","createdAt":"2021-10-31T18:58:12.878Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/47659646.gp5","personId":2240565,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Alison Hell","artist":"Annihilator","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":458745,"songId":25444,"description":"Minor changes.","createdAt":"2021-09-17T10:29:59.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/47096709.gp5","personId":290579,"person":"heavenly.tiger","title":"Alison Hell","artist":"Annihilator","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":354980,"songId":25444,"description":"- Correctly named all the tracks\n- Added a separate lead and clean guitar track\n- Made changes to bass parts throughout the song as according to Jeff Waters instructional video\n- Made changes to plenty of riffs to better fit the record \n- Significantly rewrote ALL of the drum track fit the record and spaced it out for readability\n- Made minor tempo changes\n- Added markers throughout the song and named the song structure\n*Have not added the harmony on bars 113-115*","createdAt":"2018-05-30T20:22:24.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/37417173.gp5","personId":459580,"person":"Shreddy Krueger","title":"Alison Hell","artist":"Annihilator","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":272121,"songId":25444,"description":"P.M. added","createdAt":"2016-07-20T05:11:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/19213196.gp5","personId":942333,"person":"EGL","title":"Alison Hell","artist":"Annihilator","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
