[{"revisionId":413847,"songId":83226,"description":"- Minor changes to lyrics and vocals\n- Separated verses 1 and 2\n- Put all of the main rhythm guitar parts into one track for most situations. Also removed the different way of playing the verse riff on the guitar 1 part.\n- Renamed tracks\n- General corrections to the already existing guitar parts\n- Added guitar parts for The Straightener. Drum and bass parts are still missing, however, the guitar parts should be mostly accurate and complete.","createdAt":"2020-08-19T22:40:55.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/42978796.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Wheels Of Confusion","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":352395,"songId":83226,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2018-04-17T14:08:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36690436.gp5","personId":97307,"person":"Bryan ","title":"Wheels Of Confusion","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
