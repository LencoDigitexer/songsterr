This song is a lot harder than it seems. Spent a lot of time completely accurately tabbing out the drums up until the second verse. Also changed the tempo to the more accurate 100bpm. The complete drum master track is available on Youtube, all the articulations tabbed out are in the mix you hear, except drowned out by other instruments and the recording equipment of the time. I am still messing around with the dynamics, so it is possible that I will post another revision, the only thing that will be done are changes to the articulations. This drum tab is for people who want to learn the drum part with 100% accuracy. I suggest you download this file and open it in a program such as tux guitar, where you can mute the other tracks, and here the articulations more clear. I think I might leave verse 2 ownwards unchanged, as many people are here for the guitar and only desire a steady backbeat.","createdAt":"2021-02-16T04:23:22.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44745537.gp5","personId":796911,"person":"ThomasDaDude","title":"Take The Money And Run","artist":"Steve Miller Band","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":75516,"songId":60143,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2010-05-11T14:22:25.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/3676385.gp5","personId":49439,"person":"munay","title":"Take The Money And Run","artist":"Steve Miller Band","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
