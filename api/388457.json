The rhythm of the tab was mostly correct, it just had the wrong drums in some places. I'm still unsure about the blast beats though, since they are damned hard to hear and so fast. Inferno also has a lot more cymbals than MIDI has, so the exact cymbals may not be correct, but the timing should be. I also made some notation improvements and added let-rings to the outro.","createdAt":"2017-01-19T04:34:53.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24546068.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel","artist":"Behemoth","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":277207,"songId":388457,"description":"Some minor improvements","createdAt":"2016-08-18T09:49:18.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/19960081.gp5","personId":963813,"person":"Lem","title":"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel","artist":"Behemoth","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
