[{"revisionId":259452,"songId":22517,"description":"1) Correction made to bass guitar in 1st bar of each of the chorus sections (the guitar continues to play a B5 on beat 3 & 4, but the bass plays a D (minor 3rd of Bm chord).\n2) Drums added. Please note, as I am not a drummer, this is an approximation of the drum part. I got this to sound pretty close to the album recording, but it is not completely note for note, especially in the fills, and the hi-hats. Drummers please feel free to modify and improve this drum arrangement.","createdAt":"2015-09-23T03:59:02.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17546556.gp4","personId":888183,"person":"southampton guitar academy","title":"Fire And Water","artist":"Free","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
