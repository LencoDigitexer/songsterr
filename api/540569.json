[{"revisionId":582361,"songId":540569,"description":"Added piano to the middle section, and also cleaned up the tempo in the middle section. There is piano accompanying the strings in the end section but I don't play piano so I wasn't able to figure it out.\r\n\r\nThe tempo for the end section is wrong, it's half what it should be, but I'm going to leave it because it's not easy to change in guitar pro once you've already made everything. So I apologise, maybe I'll get around to it another day.","createdAt":"2023-06-13T20:18:17.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/57554278.gp5","personId":2072721,"person":"Ferdy","title":"Downhill","artist":"Rishloo","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":559226,"songId":540569,"description":"Added the bass track.\r\nI think I'm happy to say this one is done.\r\nEnjoy :D","createdAt":"2023-03-31T17:55:09.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56155105.gp5","personId":2072721,"person":"Ferdy","title":"Downhill","artist":"Rishloo","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":558058,"songId":540569,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2023-03-26T20:48:52.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56072433.gp5","personId":2072721,"person":"Ferdy","title":"Downhill","artist":"Rishloo","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
