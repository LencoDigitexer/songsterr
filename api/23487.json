[{"revisionId":220943,"songId":23487,"description":"Cut a few measures at the end. Removed the applause track. Removed the jazz guitar track, as it was a carbon copy of the clean guitar track. Fixed the glitchy clean guitar: removed the up/down pickstrokes, removed the tapping (?), fixed the accents and staccatos. Fixed volume in the guitar. Added chord names.","createdAt":"2013-04-29T02:48:07.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/12057881.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Maybe (Live At Slane)","artist":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
