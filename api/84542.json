[{"revisionId":222165,"songId":84542,"description":"Removed useless rests and fixed notation + volume. Fixed the timing error around Chorus 2 and ugly dissonance in guitar at Chorus 3. Made drums readable. Separated distortion guitar from main guitar, although the solo still seems messy. Changed jazz guitar to clean guitar. Made lyric placement more accurate.","createdAt":"2013-05-26T19:58:11.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/12102074.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"The Zephyr Song (Live At Slane Castle)","artist":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
