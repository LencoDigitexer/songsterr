If my changes seem to be too \"live\", it would be possible to make a separate live version which is also played a little faster like about 90 bpm.","createdAt":"2022-06-25T08:54:55.241Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/50856958.gp5","personId":2238598,"person":"mattmaniak","title":"Exercises In Futility I","artist":"Mgla","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":414158,"songId":402428,"description":"Some riff changes (changed major 2nd to minor 2nd where it should be and some more detail to the main riff).
