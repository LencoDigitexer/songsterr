Fixed some of the rhythms that were off. There are actually a lot of ghosted snare notes in the original track, but sadly GP5 can't process them. Altered/fixed a few guitar licks, specifically the tapping at 73 and the arpeggios in 101-137. There are still a couple scales that are off in 47 and 51 but I didn't have time to fix them.","createdAt":"2014-04-12T15:16:17.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15334254.gp5","personId":409602,"person":"Arknot","title":"Satch Boogie","artist":"Joe Satriani","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
