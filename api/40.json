This should help with keeping the beat for you drummers, as well as general readability while learning. No more ugly 2/4 time signature mid song. Added the correct closed repeat to the beginning to help reduce the measure count of our nearly doubled count. Its actually about x1.9 without the repeat because 1.5 BPM matters that much to 51 measures. Re-implemented the correct ghost notation because while it might be drowned out in the full composition, the song was originally just an solo-acoustic/vocals arrangement. Adjusted both vocal tracks in preparation to adding lyrics. And finally added said lyrics, which shouldn't be offset; if they are: I will fix them.","createdAt":"2022-12-23T07:17:31.828Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/54182563.gp5","personId":2495436,"person":"Adam","title":"Something In The Way","artist":"Nirvana","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":389377,"songId":40,"description":"Fixed guitars, cleaned up bass and drum tracks, fixed cello tuning","createdAt":"2019-11-27T17:50:38.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40681535.gp5","personId":1928011,"person":"Cole Jensen","title":"Something In The Way","artist":"Nirvana","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":389309,"songId":40,"description":"noob, just listen to it on youtube \"Nirvana - Something In The Way (Drums Only)\", if you have ears of course .. google \"multitracks .mogg\"","createdAt":"2019-11-26T19:40:04.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40675452.gp4","personId":1070570,"person":"kiruha","title":"Something In The Way","artist":"Nirvana","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":389109,"songId":40,"description":"Old tab is convoluted, filled with unnecessary ringing notes and pointless ghost notes.
