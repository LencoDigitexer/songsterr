[{"revisionId":563498,"songId":72608,"description":"Done the entire song! :D\r\nI've arranged the guitars into a couple parts, putting all the fun riffs in one and the rhythm riffs in the other.\r\nThe tapping riff is super fun to play, it flows very easily, but it's pretty tricky to learn initially.\r\n\r\nThe bassline is very nice in this song, it's very hard to hear so I got a little creative but it sounds as close to the song as I can get. I used that particular tuning because it made a lot of parts easier, and I believe Jon used that tuning for most of Themata's songs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope you guys enjoy!","createdAt":"2023-04-15T20:49:31.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56457522.gp5","personId":2072721,"person":"Ferdy","title":"Sleeping Satellite","artist":"Karnivool","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":90331,"songId":72608,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2011-02-26T01:17:23.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/3954467.gp5","personId":156047,"person":"Mike","title":"Sleeping Satellite","artist":"Karnivool","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
