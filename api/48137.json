[{"revisionId":169616,"songId":48137,"description":"I changed up the chords for the acoustic guitar to a more accurate progression. I also changed the sting ensamble part to match. I changed the name of the instruments to the correct abnd member and i edited the solo a bit. Last, i put a capo on the acoustic. Thats all the big stuff. Might be some minor things but I know that this is more accurate than the last version. Thank you.","createdAt":"2011-11-21T01:24:22.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/10543818.gp5","personId":284034,"person":"Charlie","title":"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?","artist":"The Offspring","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
