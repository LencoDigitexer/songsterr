Changes are most noticeable in Chorus, Intro and Outro. Kept the Verses as is, since in the recording they're just eighth notes open E, so the current version is more interesting and fun to play.\n\nWill revisit when I have some time using Kello Gonzalez's great cover from Youtube to check if I missed anything.","createdAt":"2022-06-20T20:37:53.082Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/50792802.gp5","personId":2010839,"person":"joostm8","title":"Washington Is Next","artist":"Megadeth","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":382006,"songId":24187,"description":"Changed Dave's section in pre-solo harmony.
