[{"revisionId":271900,"songId":13875,"description":"I redid most of the bass line (and yes, I am aware that some of the rhythms in the chorus are wrong. Chris seems to change up beats 3 and 4 everytime, so I just kept the same rhythm the whole time). Also added a distortion channel for the bass, added names, changed it to english (for the most part. Tux guitar for some reason does not want to change the notes where it says an instrument is entering), and added a few bits to the drum line in the solo (however, I accidentally put the snare on the wrong line, making the drums even messier  than they already were. I admit my mistake Calcon, so plz don't kill me D:). If you noticed anything wrong, please write an error report on it. This is my first time transcribing and I had a few issues with the save, so there's sure to be errors.","createdAt":"2016-07-13T23:27:37.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/19175368.gp5","personId":970727,"person":"Rockn","title":"Recess","artist":"Muse","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
