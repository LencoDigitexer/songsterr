[{"revisionId":577312,"songId":18397,"description":"Fixed incorret reprises on chorus exit and outro, rewritten bass from scratch, fixed guitar riffs that were too swinged, added synth lines on chorus. James Iha's guitar is also accompaning synth line on chorus to make it more melodic. Song is in Drop C now (my band play it like that. The song in C Standard, so next revision can switch it back if they want). Tempo was adjusted according to original audio (which may cause some jarring changes here and there).","createdAt":"2023-05-29T04:55:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/57257564.gp","personId":2613947,"person":"Vinicius Braescher Moreira","title":"The Everlasting Gaze","artist":"Smashing Pumpkins","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":345506,"songId":18397,"description":"Fix broken reprises","createdAt":"2018-02-27T16:43:23.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36427485.gp5","personId":939770,"person":"Alex","title":"The Everlasting Gaze","artist":"Smashing Pumpkins","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":237533,"songId":18397,"description":"The first tab is incomplete.
