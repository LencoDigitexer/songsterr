Also fixed the intro and outro, along with most of the first and second solo. The harmony part was tough, so if you see any errors please feel free to fix it because I don't really have an ear for harmonies. The bass parts (for the most part) were not fixed but are still mostly correct. Unfortunately, I have to manually fix all of the double dotted notes with the songsterr tab editor after I import it, because I use tuxguitar to import the files.","createdAt":"2023-09-10T07:54:36.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/59297312.gp5","personId":2380382,"person":"baconeez3","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":614610,"songId":543201,"description":"If you listen to the original song closely with headphones you can hear that the the second 6th fret at bar 181 is extended and the 4th fret doesn't exist.\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-09-06T15:37:34.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/59295880.gp","personId":2708940,"person":"farhad","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":573821,"songId":543201,"description":"bend the Lenny Kravitz riff\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-05-18T00:36:49.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/57060069.gp","personId":2520698,"person":"Dean Maged","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":1},{"revisionId":570511,"songId":543201,"description":"there is a slight hammer-on in the isolated tracks\r\nfixed everything until m. 128 because I'm too lazy","createdAt":"2023-05-08T01:15:42.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56879219.gp","personId":2380382,"person":"baconeez3","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":6},{"revisionId":569745,"songId":543201,"description":"The bass is not tuned","createdAt":"2023-05-05T20:05:17.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56832107.gp5","personId":2495389,"person":"Julien AUBRY","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":569725,"songId":543201,"description":"336\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-05-05T19:18:56.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56830656.gp","personId":2494025,"person":"WÅ‚odek","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":564366,"songId":543201,"description":"some bozo messed the entire song up","createdAt":"2023-04-18T21:41:12.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56523292.gp","personId":2254891,"person":"roland homie","title":"Inamorata","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[{"kind":"other","summary":"Guitar Pro refuses to open this on my computer.
