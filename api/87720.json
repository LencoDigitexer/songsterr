Why? 1. Songsterr glitches out with repeats on renders sometimes. 2. Vocals end differently everytime. If I use alternate endings, it will also have a possibility of glitching out the tab itself on songsterr. Songsterr has a very tedious player...\n\nThis tab is looking more and more like the song completely. Hopefully Coming Home can be done next when I am finished with Pareidolia.","createdAt":"2022-04-27T08:08:27.865Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/50029703.gp5","personId":1900642,"person":"Clay","title":"Pareidolia","artist":"Kevin Sherwood","tracksCount":11,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":490225,"songId":87720,"description":"- Small fix on the bass outro effect\n- Volume fade out to the end, hopefully songsterr recognizes it (it seems to recognize some volume dip)\n- Added tied notes to Piano 1\non that topic, Piano 1 is corrupted and even making a new track didn't help, so Opening the tab in gp5 WILL crash/halt the program.
