Switched it to an overdrive guitar to keep most of the sound but hopefully make it quieter.\r\n\r\nAlso, felt that some of the tremolo on this track wasn't quite there, so they have been replaced by just standard quarter notes. Plus, I removed the parts on m. 16-17, as the guitar part comes in on the prechorus at m. 18, not the start at m. 16.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T15:59:02.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/59297050.gp5","personId":2663001,"person":"Vaibhav Duggirala","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":615816,"songId":500132,"description":"Still a little too loud. Dropping the distortion guitar as low as it can go. When I max my earbud volume and Solo the track, it sounds like just barely audible static, with the pitches also somehow still intact.

It can go lower, though; the more I listen, the more I can't really tell where the distortion guitar is, as it really just sounds like all bass. Bass is already cranked up to max though, so I've just brought down the same distortion guitar more.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T15:22:12.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/59297032.gp5","personId":2663001,"person":"Vaibhav Duggirala","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":615798,"songId":500132,"description":"Quieted the distortion guitar a lot, it drowned out everything else whenever it played. Turns out I don't have to manually adjust every note's dynamic in the sheet music, but rather turn the Volume knob for the instrument in the Properties menu in Tuxguitar. Will see if this is an acceptable volume on Songsterr.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T15:09:53.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/59297022.gp5","personId":2663001,"person":"Vaibhav Duggirala","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":606973,"songId":500132,"description":"Slowed tempo down from 100 to 95; slight change but it makes a world of difference when comparing with the official audio.\r\n\r\nEven if it sounded cooler, the drum tab was entirely wrong. I have rewritten every single measure with the appropriate notes, lengths, accents and details (see the text above certain measures). \r\n\r\nThere's a MuseScore tab (made a year before this Songsterr tab) with a drum part that looks identical to this, so I have to assume it was copied entirely from that old tab. I'm all for reducing work, but not using your own ears to confirm accuracy is how these incorrect tabs spread everywhere and confuse players.","createdAt":"2023-08-17T23:10:12.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/58964299.gp5","personId":2663001,"person":"Vaibhav Duggirala","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":475625,"songId":500132,"description":"Changed guitar sound","createdAt":"2022-01-13T19:01:39.831Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/48641072.gp5","personId":1880944,"person":"zozocookie","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":475624,"songId":500132,"description":"Intro fixed","createdAt":"2022-01-13T18:54:49.634Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/48640781.gp5","personId":1880944,"person":"zozocookie","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":475622,"songId":500132,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2022-01-13T18:40:20.716Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/48640417.gp5","personId":1880944,"person":"zozocookie","title":"Time To Make History (Persona 4 Golden)","artist":"Shihoko Hirata","tracksCount":12,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
