The band played it in drop D and it was sped up after the fact, making the pitch in between D and D#. For ease of playing along with, Songsterr lets you reset the tuning to drop D near the top of the player.","createdAt":"2018-07-20T16:10:39.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/37681922.gp5","personId":989750,"person":"magicguy38","title":"Black Hole Sun","artist":"Soundgarden","tracksCount":10,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":256454,"songId":227,"description":"Added Drums","createdAt":"2015-07-15T14:42:56.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/17381544.gp5","personId":714429,"person":"Niko","title":"Black Hole Sun","artist":"Soundgarden","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
