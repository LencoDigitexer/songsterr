Here's the points I changed:\n\n\n1. Added full metadata (score information and original player of each instrument).\n\n2. Added playing tips and recommended effects for lead guitar and bass.\n\n3. Added markers for each section of the song.\n\n4. Added vocals. Vocals display lyrics in sync with the score.\n\n5. Added chord display for each instrument.\n\n6. Changed keyboard from \"recorder\" to \"hammond organ\" and \"rhodes piano\". Originally a Vox Continental is used.\n\n7. Improved timing, chord fingerings and strumming patterns for the rhythmic guitar.\n\n\n8. Improved effects for lead guitar.\n\n9. Changed background riff that plays at the third verse.\n\n10. Improved bass figures. Added suggested lines according to live performances.\n\n11. Improved drums A LOT. It sounded very \"jungley\".","createdAt":"2016-02-15T08:59:57.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/18128500.gp5","personId":1027407,"person":"Pelusteriano","title":"505","artist":"Arctic Monkeys","tracksCount":9,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
