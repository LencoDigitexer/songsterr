[{"revisionId":366101,"songId":447462,"description":"First: The bass line I put down had a total of three different versions being played, but after a while I noticed there was a fourth version being played at the end. So I fixed that.\nSecond: The extra percussion track had a super annoying DJ sound being played as well as extra cymbals. I originally had it because the DJ sound sounded like a cymbal in Guitar Pro. The reason I had the cymbals in the first place was because the actual song has a bunch of ringing in a section. I later realized that the extra cymbals and DJ sound was stupidly annoying and inaccurate, so I removed the section.\nLastly: The guitar at the end plays an alternate version of the same riff at the end. I originally had the section as ABAB, but listening to the actually song the section is AAAB, so I fixed that accordingly. \nPS: Some of the text was glitched, so I fixed the text in the song.","createdAt":"2018-12-06T20:53:22.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/38466857.gp5","personId":1233597,"person":"Joseph","title":"Kids in the Hall intro","artist":"Theme Songs","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":365161,"songId":447462,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2018-11-19T22:54:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/38355095.gp5","personId":1233597,"person":"Joseph","title":"Kids in the Hall intro","artist":"Theme Songs","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
