I worked out the tuning from where Jon was playing on the fretboard live. And yes, it is safe to tune those strings a whole note higher.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about drums I'm afraid so I wasn't able to make a drum track, but if somebody would like to do the drums please feel free, it is super easy to sync the song to the tab in Guitar Pro.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you guys enjoy!","createdAt":"2023-04-27T18:53:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56679920.gp5","personId":2072721,"person":"Ferdy","title":"Deadman","artist":"Karnivool","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":90332,"songId":72609,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2011-02-26T01:17:24.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/3954468.gp5","personId":156047,"person":"Mike","title":"Deadman","artist":"Karnivool","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
