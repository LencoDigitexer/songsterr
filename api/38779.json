[{"revisionId":215669,"songId":38779,"description":"Full replacement of the previous version, which was the wrong song.  This is NOT a perfect transcription, which is very difficult to do in GuitarPro (2 voices, multiple tied notes), but it's as close as you'll find in Internet.  I recommend to check Pablo Elorza's transcription in YouTube (no tabs, only standard notation).","createdAt":"2012-12-30T11:22:22.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/11868344.gp5","personId":153820,"person":"FerK","title":"Continuum","artist":"Jaco Pastorius","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
