Trust me, this version's guitar solo is way more accurate to the original especially at bar 56. As far as other parts go (like the E minor \"lick\" at bars 44 and 60), this version is also much more accurate. Also things like bar 26 are more true to the original and much easier to play. This is all my opinion, I'm not going to argue with you if you roll it back, but in my opinion this is way more accurate.
