All of the triplet-based rhythms were wonky in the last revision, everything is on time now. Drums are also 100% correct now, I notated them straight from the original drum track. A lot of riffs are also fixed, and the tuning is now D standard (Every song from Trendkill is actually tuned a little bit flat, about A=430). I'll also add bass soon.","createdAt":"2017-01-28T15:36:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/24571786.gp5","personId":1126131,"person":"Pan-fukin'-tera","title":"War Nerve","artist":"Pantera","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":293639,"songId":15010,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2016-10-31T09:23:55.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/22870382.gp4","personId":33,"person":"Leland","title":"War Nerve","artist":"Pantera","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
