[{"revisionId":221347,"songId":7645,"description":"Gave proper names to track titles and markers. \nAdded/removed some guitar chord names. Added lots of let rings. Fixed solo guitar. Fixed some bass notation. Tried to fix drums but there's too much going on for me to listen to it correctly, so I removed some stuff. Changed distortion guitar to overdrive because it sounds more accurate. Fixed incorrect measure around Verse 3.","createdAt":"2013-05-09T01:24:00.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/12073114.gp5","personId":296309,"person":"Deleted user","title":"Interior Two","artist":"John Frusciante","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
