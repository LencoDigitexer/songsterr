[{"revisionId":232326,"songId":23957,"description":"I fixed the bass, guitars, and drums to an extent. The main goal of this was for the bass and guitars.

So, enjoy.","createdAt":"2014-01-04T23:50:19.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/15103225.gp5","personId":440164,"person":"Joxe","title":"Colony Of Birchmen","artist":"Mastodon","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
