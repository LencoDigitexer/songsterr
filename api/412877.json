In their performance of Master of Puppets on the Howard Stern Show, if you look into Rob's eyes, he is closely following James. The same situation is present in this song as well. By the way, the synch is not correct, so I would appreciate it if someone more experienced could correct it.","createdAt":"2023-03-26T23:09:21.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56074708.gp5","personId":1496557,"person":"Beek X","title":"Moth Into Flame","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":422209,"songId":412877,"description":"Fixed solo","createdAt":"2020-11-08T08:56:50.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/43759637.gp5","personId":1331165,"person":"banddd","title":"Moth Into Flame","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":391309,"songId":412877,"description":"I added Backing Vocals, Corrected the bass for the 1st few seconds, and Re-Added the Extra Guitar if I was meant to do that, and renamed the Tracks","createdAt":"2019-12-22T08:32:02.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40861937.gp5","personId":1005456,"person":"Slushy Guy","title":"Moth Into Flame","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":354775,"songId":412877,"description":"Added dynamics (accents and ghost notes) on drum track.","createdAt":"2018-05-26T20:08:19.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/37397864.gp5","personId":1300206,"person":"Alan Picazo","title":"Moth Into Flame","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":354771,"songId":412877,"description":"Rewrote drum track\nAdjusted volumes","createdAt":"2018-05-26T19:30:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/37397542.gp5","personId":1300206,"person":"Alan Picazo","title":"Moth Into Flame","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":345082,"songId":412877,"description":"Added Lyrics.","createdAt":"2018-02-20T18:12:27.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/36386882.gp5","personId":1392736,"person":"Eddie The Head","title":"Moth Into Flame","artist":"Metallica","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":345008,"songId":412877,"description":"Added Lyrics !
