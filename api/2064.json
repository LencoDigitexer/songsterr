The intro part is now 100% correct as well as some of the beginning after. The first chorus is, and I would have done the 2nd chorus but someone made it using repeats so I just corrected the part but not the repeat. Someone should really rewrite the song not using repeats, that would make it easier to fix. Also fixed some minor errors. AND ALSO, THAT TRIPLET FILL IN THE BEGINNING IS SOME HARD TABBING, honestly I don't know the rev thinks of this stuff, (ig chorus, fills, etc) but he really is a god.","createdAt":"2015-03-31T04:06:58.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/16104438.gp5","personId":796911,"person":"ThomasDaDude","title":"Radiant Eclipse","artist":"Avenged Sevenfold","tracksCount":4,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
