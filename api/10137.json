[{"revisionId":639665,"songId":10137,"description":"Moved the section starting and ending Luke's Wall from 7th position to 12th position, based on what Tony does in every live performance I could see him doing it in (5 or 6 of them, both early and late). Also changed the trill part of the solo to a bend on the 9th fret rather than moving up to the 11th, as that's what he did early in his career and is likely more accurate to the album version (check California Jam and live in Paris 1970 if you're curious). It is worth nothing that, as previously mentioned, later on, he slides up to 11 rather than bending 9 up to that Bb (in live from The End, for example)","createdAt":"2023-11-12T23:50:57.439Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/war_pigs.102262.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":627723,"songId":10137,"description":"Reverted to my previous version\r\nNOTE TO PEOPLE WHO MAY BE CHANGING THINGS:\r\nAs far as I know, the fingerings are what Tony Iommi plays live, they're not all optimal, but that's how he plays the song, and that's the way I believe it should be tabbed. The only part of the song I've noticed he plays differently is the 11 9 7 9 7 9 part of the solos, where he sometimes bends 9 up to 11, sometimes does it all HO/POs as it's tabbed, or sometimes slides up to 11 and then back down to 9.","createdAt":"2023-10-10T23:03:22.988Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49276435.491492.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":574077,"songId":10137,"description":"fixed tapping section\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-05-18T20:32:47.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/57072422.gp","personId":2553028,"person":"Danilostvs","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":566111,"songId":10137,"description":"I messed up\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-04-24T21:44:05.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56625519.gp","personId":2593797,"person":"WalkerEnglizh","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":566106,"songId":10137,"description":"The same sound, different fingerings for optimal speed and comfort.\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-04-24T21:29:19.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56625393.gp","personId":2593797,"person":"WalkerEnglizh","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":566104,"songId":10137,"description":"much faster to play up here than to go down and up. the same, but with different fingering\r\n(via editor)","createdAt":"2023-04-24T21:26:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/56625245.gp","personId":2593797,"person":"WalkerEnglizh","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":482179,"songId":10137,"description":"Various changes for accuracy and ease of reading","createdAt":"2022-02-24T01:28:47.376Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49276435.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":454782,"songId":10137,"description":"Various minor corrections here and there on guitar tracks","createdAt":"2021-08-21T20:35:53.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/46743730.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"War Pigs","artist":"Black Sabbath","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":451434,"songId":10137,"description":"Changed the BAss (center) track to Bass (center).
