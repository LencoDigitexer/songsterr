Also doubled the length of the riff so there's more practice time with it.","createdAt":"2022-04-06T15:21:48.504Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49776995.gp5","personId":2184248,"person":"Z Bunk","title":"Walk With Me In Hell & Embers Riffs","artist":"Practice","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":488025,"songId":505720,"description":"Changed the tempo when the Embers riff starts to match the actual speed differences in the songs, and got rid of some of the 32nd notes in the Walk With Me In Hell breakdown section because they were just really wonky (and they're not actually in the breakdown anyway, just thought it would be good rhythm practice for the verse riffs).","createdAt":"2022-04-06T14:58:42.793Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49776821.gp5","personId":2184248,"person":"Z Bunk","title":"Walk With Me In Hell & Embers Riffs","artist":"Practice","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":487936,"songId":505720,"description":"Overlooked a few palm mutes in the first submission, and changed it from an overdriven guitar to a distorted guitar.","createdAt":"2022-04-05T20:28:02.033Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49769264.gp5","personId":2184248,"person":"Z Bunk","title":"Walk With Me In Hell & Embers Riffs","artist":"Practice","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":487924,"songId":505720,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2022-04-05T20:10:16.175Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/49768280.gp5","personId":2184248,"person":"Z Bunk","title":"Walk With Me In Hell & Embers Riffs","artist":"Practice","tracksCount":1,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
