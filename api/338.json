I revised it using isolated tracks of each instrument, found here: <https://remixpacks.ru/load/2/rock-1-0-3765/>\n\nSo here's what I did:\n- Merged the vocal harmony track into the main vocal track\n- Lots of rhythm guitar revisions. Dave and Adrian now have the correct harmonies throughout the song. There were a couple spots where differed slightly in rhythm, as heard in the isolated tracks. Also added all of the rhythm guitars under the solos.\n- Reverted the bass track to the correct version, with corrections.\n- Reverted the drum track to the Nov 2014 version, so it is readable.\n- Revised the solos.","createdAt":"2019-06-02T13:33:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39480850.gp5","personId":551392,"person":"Steve","title":"The Trooper","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":7,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":363611,"songId":338,"description":"Fixed solos.","createdAt":"2018-10-23T11:24:30.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/38223036.gp5","personId":1540430,"person":"Daniel Raven","title":"The Trooper","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":265293,"songId":338,"description":"Fixed volumes.","createdAt":"2016-02-23T15:02:40.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/18176090.gp5","personId":951097,"person":"Shadows","title":"The Trooper","artist":"Iron Maiden","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
