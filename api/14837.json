[{"revisionId":177624,"songId":14837,"description":"Changed the initial riff to resemble what Andy Summers actually plays. (although not entirely, did not tab out the variations and the very beginning).\n\nPlease see source:\n\nAndy Live on the Synchronicity Tour: http://youtu.be/ydLe_Tjcr08\nPretty accurate cover: http://youtu.be/PnV-_SaJVU4\n\nAlso added some notes on the effects (seems to be Flanger + Delay initially, no overdrive). Big Muff Pi later on.\n\nSomeone else can edit the tab to match what those 2 videos show. (Andy's is pretty clear from 1:20 on).","createdAt":"2012-05-13T00:51:21.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/11537541.gp4","personId":406070,"person":"Marc","title":"Invisible Sun","artist":"The Police","tracksCount":6,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
