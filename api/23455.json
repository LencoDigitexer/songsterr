A lot of people think it is crazy triplets/sextuplets, and sometimes it is, but for the majority of the song it is just swung sixteenths. Looked at them playing it life and it is definitely what they play.\nI have tried to implement every single variation of the riff I heard in the official song.\nFinished the drums and bass.\nSome parts of the bass and lots of the drums may be off by some notes here and there.\nChanged a few notes on the guitar track but mostly left it alone.\nSources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=953PkxFNiko\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHQ8JYcoZH8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBKAlxCiEHA","createdAt":"2021-02-24T10:54:12.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/44836156.gp5","personId":1233597,"person":"Joseph","title":"My Name Is Mud","artist":"Primus","tracksCount":5,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":377826,"songId":23455,"description":"Fixed all\n-fretless bass\n-rainbow Bass\n-Larry ibanez","createdAt":"2019-06-17T10:58:48.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/39559439.gp5","personId":1712686,"person":"Xavier","title":"My Name Is Mud","artist":"Primus","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":362365,"songId":23455,"description":"Fixed guitar, added drums","createdAt":"2018-10-01T15:23:15.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/38110118.gp5","personId":1597367,"person":"Duzhiy","title":"My Name Is Mud","artist":"Primus","tracksCount":3,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":31937,"songId":23455,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2009-04-29T09:09:51.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/3639741.gp4","personId":703,"person":"ruvik","title":"My Name Is Mud","artist":"Primus","tracksCount":2,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
