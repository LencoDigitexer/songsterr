I never heard it in the song, and it sounded really bad.\nRemoved most of what the clean guitar plays, other than the interlude section.\nRenamed some tracks.\nRedid the ENTIRE drum part. It's much better than it was before, and I believe it's nearly perfect. Nobody would like Pink Floyd if Nick just beat the hell out of the snare drum every single beat.\nReworked a few measures in the overdrive guitar part. Some of them sounded really bad and had the wrong chords. Added some fills where they needed to be.\nMessed with some of the rhythms in the bass solos at the beginning and after the interlude.\nSeparated the outro solo and the effects throughout the song into two tracks.","createdAt":"2019-09-20T19:33:13.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/40089415.gp5","personId":1445963,"person":"Dang","title":"Pigs (Three Different Ones)","artist":"Pink Floyd","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0},{"revisionId":49402,"songId":34743,"description":"Initial revision","createdAt":"2009-10-23T10:34:12.000Z","source":"https://gp.songsterr.com/3652729.gp5","personId":13083,"person":"Skullbasher007","title":"Pigs (Three Different Ones)","artist":"Pink Floyd","tracksCount":8,"reports":[],"commentsCount":0}]
